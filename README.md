NASA Data Explorer
===============

Topic and Purpose
----------------------
The NASA Data Explorer is a web application which manipulates and visualizes NASA Exoplanet Archive Public datasets covering planets and stars gathered by NASAâ€™s space exploration missions. The specific dataset visualized is the Planetary Systems Composite Planet Data Table.

Machine Learning
---------------------
The web application has a feature to predict the number of exoplanets that will be found given past data on discovery years, using machine learning. Another ML feature is its ability to predicting how many new exoplanets each involved facility will discovery in the period of 1, 5 or 10 years. 

Calculations
----------------
The web application allows users to find the average mass of planets within the same stellar host, or the avergae number of stars/exoplanets found per year or per 5 years. 

Data Visualization
----------------------
The web application plots the densities of the planets in each stellar host to compare against each other. The user is able to pick which stellar host's planets' densities to plot.

Data Sources
--------
[This table](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PSCompPars) displays all information for confirmed planets and host stars. It contains data on stellar and planetary parameters for known exoplanets. For instance, some of the data in the dataset includes number of stars, number of planets, planet mass, radius, discovery year, and discovery facility.
